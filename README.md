# Computer Vision Blur Detector

A computer vision project that classifies whether an image is **blurred** or **not blurred** using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes a user-friendly Gradio interface and Grad-CAM visualizations to explain the model's decisions.

---

## Features

- Classifies images as blurred or not blurred
- Uses a custom CNN model
- Supports Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight what parts of the image influenced the decision
- Interactive Gradio web app with captioned overlays
- Side-by-side layout with prediction + heatmap
- Confidence score shown with each prediction

---

## Model Architecture

A simple CNN with two convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers:

Conv2D (32 filters) ‚Üí MaxPooling  
‚Üí Conv2D (64 filters) ‚Üí MaxPooling  
‚Üí Flatten ‚Üí Dense (64) ‚Üí Output (1, Sigmoid)

- Loss: `binary_crossentropy`  
- Optimizer: `adam`  
- Metric: `accuracy`

## Grad-CAM Explanation

Grad-CAM overlays help visualize which regions the model focused on during classification:

- üî¥ Red / üü° Yellow: High   attention (important areas)
- üîµ Blue: Low attention

This makes the CNN more explainable and shows *why* the model classified an image as blurred or not.

## Gradio Interface

After launching the app, you can:

Upload an image  
- See if it‚Äôs blurred or not blurred
- View a Grad-CAM heatmap overlay  
- Get the model‚Äôs confidence score
- Enjoy a clean side-by-side layout with white background and black text
